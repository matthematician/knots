<introduction>

<p>We now turn to the question: how can we construct examples of knot invariants which are, themselves, algebraic structures? How can we encode the language of knot diagrams and diagram equivalence into the language of sets and binary operations (that is, magmas)?</p>

<p>We'll begin with something we already know to be an example of a knot invariant: colorability. If we can encode the colorability <q>rules</q> from <xref ref="def_kcolorable"/> into the properties of an algebraic operation, perhaps we will be on the path to algebraic invariants.</p>

<activity xml:id="act_step1">
    <statement>
        <p>Suppose three arcs of a knot diagram meet at a crossing, and the colors of these arcs are represented by three numbers <m>x,y,z</m>.</p>
        <p><term>(a)</term> Which of the following equations is definitely true when <m>x=y=z</m>?</p>
        <p><term>(b)</term> Which of the following equations is definitely false when <m>x=y</m> but <m>z</m> does not equal <m>x</m>?</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><m>(x-y)(x-z)(y-z)=0</m></p></li>
                <li><p><m>x +y -2z = 0</m></p></li>
                <li><p><m>x^2 + y^2 - 2z^2=0</m></p> 
            </li>
        </ol>
    </statement>
</activity>

<p>One of the most flexible ways to create an algebraic property that mimics the colorability <q>rules</q> (either all three variables must be equal, or all three must be distinct) is to make an <em>averaging</em> property. In any group of three numbers, if one is an <q>average</q> of the other two, typically this means that it somehow lies <q>between</q> (and distinct from) the two -- unless the first two are equal, in which case their average will again be equal.</p>

<activity xml:id="act_step2">
    <statement>
        <p><term>(a)</term> Which of the equations in <xref ref="act_step1"/> best expresses the idea that, among the three quantities <m>x,y,z</m>, one of them is an <em>average</em> of the other two?</p>
        <p><term>(b)</term> Most often, the colloquial word <q>average</q> means <q>arithmetic mean</q>, a number having an equal <em>amount difference</em> from each of the values of which it is an average. For example, <m>9</m> is the arithmetic mean of <m>2</m> and <m>16</m> because it is <m>7</m> units away from each of them.</p>
        <p>The <em>geometric mean</em> of two numbers has an equal <em>percent difference</em> from each of their values. For example, <m>8</m> is the geometric mean of <m>2</m> and <m>32</m> because it is a <em>factor of</em> <m>4</m> away from each of them.</p>
        <p>Write an algebraic equation that expresses the idea that, among three numbers <m>x,y,z</m>, one of them is the geometric mean of the other two.</p>
        <p><term>(c)</term> (Bonus.) What algebraic operation, applied to both sides of your answer to (b), gives you an algebraic property that looks like your answer to (a)?</p>
    </statement>
</activity>

<p>This <q>averaging</q> idea motivates the following theorem.</p>

            <theorem xml:id="thm_integeraverage">
                <statement>
                    <p>
                        Let <m>K</m> be a knot, <m>D</m> be one of its diagrams, and <me>f \colon \{ \text{arcs of }D \} \to \{0,1,2,\ldots,k-1 \}</me> be a <m>k</m>-coloration of the diagram <m>D</m>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then <m>f</m> is a valid <m>k</m>-coloration if, and only if, at every crossing of arcs <m>x_i,x_j,x_k</m>, with <m>x_k</m> being the overcrossing strand, the following equation holds: <mdn><mrow xml:id="eq_magicav">f(x_i) + f(x_j) - 2f(x_k) &amp;=0.</mrow></mdn>
                        In other words, the color of the over-strand is the average of the colors of the two under-strands.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Furthermore, this conclusion remains true if equality only holds modulo <m>k</m>:

    <title>
        Arithmetic Modulo <m>k</m>

    <statement>
        <p>Arithmetic modulo <m>k</m> means arithmetic done using only the <em>remainders</em> when numbers are divided by <m>k</m>.</p>
        <p>For example, reducing the following equation modulo 3 requires us to replace all numbers with their remainders when divided by 3:</p>

        <p>It can be shown that any equation involving addition, subtraction, and/or multiplication of integers remains true if all integers are reduced modulo <m>k</m> in this way, for any <m>k \geq 1</m>.</p>
        <p>The case <m>k=12</m> is often called <q>clock arithmetic</q>, since it encodes statements like <q>Five hours past eleven o'clock is four o'clock</q> into the modulo-12 reduction

<p>Your work in <xref ref="act_mod3"/> shows that the equation <mdn><mrow xml:id="eq_fox">\bar{x}+\bar{y}+\bar{z} \equiv 0 \pmod{3}.</mrow></mdn> perfectly captures the <xref ref="def_fox" text="custom">Fox tricolorability</xref> criteria for a knot diagram.

<figure xml:id="fig_color8">
    <image source="images/figure8-colored.png" width="50%"/>
    <caption>The figure-eight knot <m>4_1</m>, with a four-coloration by the elements of the Takasaki kei <m>\mathbb{Z}_4</m>.</caption>
    <p>For example, at the rightmost crossing on this diagram the overcrossing arc is <m>1</m> and the undercrossing arcs are <m>0</m> and <m>2</m>. So <xref ref="fig_keiop"/> gives us the two crossing relations <me>0\triangleright 1 = 2 \qquad \text{and} \qquad 2\triangleright 1=0.</me>
    Both of those adjacencies agree exactly with the corresponding entries in the operation table for the four-element Takasaki kei above.</p>
    <p>In this way, when the crossings of a knot diagram can be <q>mimicked</q> by an <m>n</m>-element Takasaki kei, we can be assured that that knot is <m>n</m>-colorable.</p>
</figure>

</statement>
</example>

<p>As <xref ref="ex_takasaki"/> suggests, the Takasaki keis <m>(\mathbb{Z}_k,\triangleright)</m> can serve as <m>k</m>-colorability <q>detectors</q> for a knot. When the adjacencies of the arcs in a knot diagram <em>themselves</em> can be mimicked by the operation of <m>(\mathbb{Z}_k,\triangleright)</m>, then the knot must be <m>k</m>-colorable. The word <q>mimicked</q> here is doing quite a bit of work, however; let's put that idea onto firmer ground.</p>

<p>We begin with a desire to construct a kei that does <em>nothing more</em> than capture how the arcs of a knot diagram come together at its crossings. This kei -- which can be quite large! -- we can think of as the <q>Rosetta stone</q> kei of the knot: it contains the most information about the knot that a kei can capture. In a sense, it is the most general algebraic invariant for an unoriented knot.</p>

<definition xml:id="def_fundkei">
    <statement>
        <p>Let <m>K</m> be a knot. Its <term>fundamental kei</term> <m>\mathcal{K}(K)</m> is the magma whose elements are words using the alphabet of its diagram's arcs <m>a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n</m>, and which have relations (<q>simplification rules</q>) given by the diagram's crossings.</p>
    </statement>
</definition>

<remark xml:id="rem_fundkei">
    <statement>
        <p>The arcs of a knot diagram are <em>generators</em> for its fundamental kei, but in general they are not its only elements. There may be words we can write using these generators and the kei operation <m>\triangleright</m> which do not correspond to arcs in the knot diagram at all.</p>
        <p>For example, in the video below we begin the construction of the fundamental kei of the figure-eight knot <m>4_1</m>. With the idempotent property we can fill in four entries in the operation table for this kei; the four crossings in the diagram give us eight further entries. However, this leaves four entries in the table undetermined. For example, <m>w\triangleright x</m> does not evaluate to any of the four arcs <m>w,x,y,z</m> of this diagram because there is no crossing at which <m>x</m> is the overcrossing arc and <m>w</m> one of its undercrossing arcs. So <m>w\triangleright x</m>, while it is an element of the fundamental kei, is not one of the diagram's arcs. </p>

        <video youtube="AMpfx-ik69A" start="765"/>

        <p>Indeed, the fundamental kei of the figure-eight knot can be shown to have eight elements, <me>\mathcal{K}(4_1) = \bigl\{ w, x, y, z, \; w\triangleright x, x\triangleright y, y\triangleright z, z\triangleright w \; \bigr\} .</me>The <xref ref="def_kei" text="custom">three kei properties</xref> can then be used to fill in all 64 entries in its operation table.

            <p>If your answer is <q>no</q>, explain how your linear algebra shows this. If your answer is <q>yes</q>, give a specific example of how your linear algebra can be used to determine a nontrivial 3-coloration for this knot.</p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>You may use the same reasoning as in <xref ref="act_62color"/>.</p>

    <exercise>
        <statement>
            <p>Use its operation table to explain why the Takasaki kei <m>(\mathbb{Z}_3,\triangleright)</m> has both the <xref ref="def_props" text="custom">left-cancel and right-cancel</xref> properties.
            </p>
            <p>What about <m>(\mathbb{Z}_4,\triangleright)</m>: does it have both the left- and right-cancel properties? (See <xref ref="ex_takasaki"/> for its operation table.) How can you tell?</p>
            <p>Make a conjecture, and give a convincing explanation or a proof: <em>Every kei has the <m>\underline{\hspace{0.5in}}</m>-cancel property.</em></p>
