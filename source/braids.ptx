<p>The <q>braid-a-gram</q> diagrams you sketched in <xref ref="algebra2"/> were our first hint of a connection between algebra (permutations) and knot-like diagrams. Trouble is, braid-a-grams aren't <em>really</em> knot-like, because their strands <em>intersect</em> one another at their crossings, something that physical strings can't do. In this section we'll fix that limitation, and then work out what happens to the algebra.</p>

<definition xml:id="def_braid">
	<statement>
		<p>A <term>braid</term> on <m>n</m> strands is a braid-a-gram, each of whose crossings is designated as either a <term>positive</term> crossing (<m>\backslash</m> over <m>/</m>) or a <term>negative</term> crossing (<m>/</m> over <m>\backslash</m>).
		</p>

		</figure>
		<p>A braid whose crossings are all positive is called a <term>positive braid</term>.</p>
	</statement>
</definition>

	We can use technology to both visualize and, later, perform algebra using braids. Execute the Sage cell below to visualize an example of a positive braid.
	<sage>
		<input>
B = BraidGroup(4);
b = B([2,1,3,2]);
b.plot( orientation='top-bottom', thickness=2 )
		</input>
	</sage>
</p>
<p>
	There is a one-to-one correspondence between positive braids and braid-a-grams. Given a positive braid, we can <q>flatten</q> all the crossings to make it a braid-a-gram; conversely, given a braid-a-gram, we can make each crossing positive to turn it into a positive braid.

		<caption>A one-to-one correspondence of braid-a-grams to positive braids.</caption>
		<image source="images/gif_yoyo.gif" width="35%"/>
	</figure>
	Accordingly, we can borrow the notation we used for adjacent transpositions to develop notation for braids as follows.
</p>
<definition xml:id="def_artin">
	<statement>
		<p>In a braid on <m>n</m> strands, for each <m>1 \leq i \leq n-1</m> we denote by <m>s_i</m> the positive crossing of the <m>i</m>-th strand over the <m>(i+1)</m>-st strand.
		</p>
	</statement>
</definition>
<activity xml:id="act_braid1">
	<statement>
		<p>Use the <m>ATOM\mapsto MOAT</m> diagram in <xref ref="fig_yoyo"/> to express the positive braid shown using the generators <m>s_1,s_2,</m> and/or <m>s_3</m>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Then, adapt the Sage code in the above cell to generate a visualization of this positive braid.

<!-- Goals here: (1) Contrast to Coxeter, (2) Use Sage to perform braid computations, (3) Pure braid stuff as ker of hom Bn -> Sn -->
