    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Demonstrate whether a given property of interest is, or is not, a knot invariant.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
</objectives>

    <p>We saw in <xref ref="knots"/> that the same knot can have (infinitely!) many different diagrams. Yet we <em>want</em> to be able to study the properties of knots, which reside in three dimensions, using diagrams which can obscure knots' three-dimensional reality. <xref ref="def_moves"/> showed exactly how <xref ref="def_isotopy" text="custom">isotopy</xref> of a knot, which leaves the <em>knot</em> unchanged, can nevertheless change its <em>diagrams</em> in very specific ways.</p>
    
    <p>So to study the properties of knots, how can we be certain that we're seeing a property that <em>transcends</em> diagrams and actually tells us something about the knot itself, regardless which diagram we've chosen to represent it? </p>

    <p>How can we be sure not to judge a knot by its cover? By studying its <q>invariant</q> properties, according to this definition.</p>

    <definition xml:id="def_invariant">
        <statement>
            <p>Let <m>K</m> be a knot. A logical property <m>P</m> is called a <term>knot invariant</term> if, for all pairs of diagrams <m>D,D'</m> of <m>K</m>, we have <me>P(D) \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad P(D').</me>
            In other words, property <m>P</m> is a knot invariant if it is either true for every possible diagram of <m>K</m>, or false for every possible diagram of <m>K</m>.</p>
        </statement>
    </definition>

<p>Every knot invariant has the power of <term>discrimination</term>: Given two diagrams <m>D_1,D_2</m> and a knot invariant <m>P</m>, if <m>P</m> is true for one diagram and false for the other, then we know for certain that those diagrams represent <em>different</em> knots. However, most knot invariants do not have the power of <term>confirmation</term>: We cannot always say that if <m>P</m> is true for <em>both</em> diagrams, then those diagrams represent the <em>same</em> knot. An invariant that does that, if one exists, is called a complete invariant. Those are the <q>holy grail</q> of knot theory, since they would completely classify all types of knots -- in the same way that the fraction of a rational tangle classified all rational tangles (<xref ref="thm_fraction"/>).</p>

<p>Since the <xref ref="def_moves" text="custom">Reidemeister moves</xref> give a <em>complete</em> list of diagram equivalencies for knots, they also are a complete set of tests for whether a diagram property is a knot invariant.</p>

<theorem xml:id="thm_invariant">
    <statement>
        <p>A diagram property <m>P</m> is a knot invariant if, and only if, it is preserved by all three Reidemeister moves.</p>
    </statement>
</theorem>

<p>In other words, to check whether a diagram property is a knot invariant -- that is, to know whether the property will either hold or not hold for <em>all</em> possible diagrams of a given knot -- we only need to check that each Reidemeister move preserves the truth value of the property.</p>

<example xml:id="ex_invariant">
    <title>One invariant and one non-invariant</title>
    <statement>
        <p>If <m>P</m> is the property <q>total number of arcs in a diagram</q>, then we can check <m>P</m> is <em>not</em> a knot invariant. All we need is to find a single Reidemeister move which <em>alters</em> the value of this property for a diagram.</p>
        <p>Let <m>K</m> be a knot and <m>D</m> be any diagram for <m>K</m>. Suppose <m>D</m> has a total of <m>n</m> arcs. How many arcs will <m>D</m> have after we apply each of the Reidemeister moves to a portion of it?</p>
        <figure xml:id="fig_invariantex">
                <caption>Arc number is <em>unchanged</em> by the Type-I and Type-III moves; however, the Type-II move results in <em>one more or one fewer</em> arc.

            </figure>
        <p>As the figure above shows, the total arc number is <term>not a knot invariant</term>, because one of the Reidemeister moves (namely, the Type-II move) <em>changes</em> the value of this property by either adding or subtracting an arc <em>without</em> changing the underlying knot.</p>

        <p>If <m>Q</m> is the property <q>the fewest number of toothpicks necessary to make a diagram</q> (called the <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stick_number">stick number</url>), then <m>Q</m> is a knot invariant.</p>
        <p>To see why, notice that the Reidemeister moves can always be used to <em>decrease</em> the number of crossings in a diagram, and each decrease can reduce the number of toothpicks needed to make the diagram. So the <em>minimal</em> number of toothpicks needed to make a diagram will be unchanged by the Reidemeister moves, even if the <em>actual</em> number might vary as we <q>twist</q> or <q>poke</q> the arcs in a diagram.
        </p>

<p>The <em>KnotInfo</em> database has a long list of knot invariants for you to browse. Each has a considerable body of literature and research behind it, and none but the most die-hard knot theorists in the world have familiarity with all of them!</p>

<p>One interesting -- and flexible, and enjoyable -- type of knot invariant has to do with colorations. How many different colors may be assigned to the arcs of a knot diagram, subject to certain coloration rules?</p>

<definition xml:id="def_fox">
            <statement>
                <p>Let <m>K</m> be a knot, and <m>D</m> be one of its diagrams. A <term>3-coloring</term> of <m>D</m> is a function <me> f \colon \{ \text{arcs of }D \} \to \{\text{red},\text{green},\text{blue}\}</me>
                which assigns one of the three colors red, green, or blue to each arc of the diagram.</p>
                <p>A 3-coloring of <m>D</m> is called a <term>valid 3-coloring</term> if each crossing of <m>D</m> is one of the following: <ul><li><p>...a meeting of three arcs of the same color, or</p></li><li><p>...a meeting of three arcs of three different colors.</p></li></ul></p>
                <p>A diagram <m>D</m> is called <term>(Fox) tricolorable</term> if there exists a valid 3-coloring of <m>D</m> <em>besides</em> the <q>trivial</q> example (all arcs the same color).</p>

        <p>The concept of tricolorability can be extended to colorability by <m>k\geq 3</m> colors as well.</p>
        <definition xml:id="def_kcolorable">
            <statement>

                which assigns one of a selection of <m>k</m> colors to each arc of the diagram.</p>
                <p>A <m>k</m>-coloring of <m>D</m> is called a <term>valid k-coloring</term> if each crossing of <m>D</m> is one of the following: <ul><li><p>...a meeting of three arcs of the same color, or</p></li><li><p>...a meeting of three arcs of three different colors.</p></li></ul></p>

        <p>An analogous argument to that for tricolorability shows that <m>k</m>-colorability is a knot invariant as well.</p>
