Representationality: Come up with two braidagrams that represent the same permutation.
 Use this to *anticipate* the Coxeter presentation:
   Represent the identity permutation using one crossing (hard)
   ...the commutation permutation using two crossings, e.g. OGRE - GOER (using that braidagrams can't have same height cross)
   ...the skein relation swapping two nonadjacent positions, e.g. STALE - SLATE

Braids goals:
 Compare and contrast w braidagrams by discovering the one minimal change Coxeter -> Artin
 Use Sage to visualize and simplify braids
 "Forgetful" homomorphism Bn -> Sn and pure braid group (= kernel of this hom)
