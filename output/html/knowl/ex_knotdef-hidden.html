<body><article class="example example-like"><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We ultimately want to think of a knot as simply a particular type of subset of points living in space. The four words -- image, smooth, simple, and closed -- ensure that we get the kinds of subsets that “look like” knots as we intuitively and physically understand them.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><dfn class="terminology">Image</dfn>: The image of a function is the set of all its “outputs”. This is also known as “range” in most high-school algebra contexts. We use the word image here so that we can forget about (most of) the details of the function \({\bf r}\) that parameterizes the knot as a curve, and think instead only of the points in space that the function traces out.</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><dfn class="terminology">Smooth</dfn>: A function is smooth if it is infinitely many times differentiable at all its points. In the case of a curve, this means that there is a well-defined tangent vector to our curve at each of its points, that those tangent vectors also vary continuously from point to point, that their variations also vary continuously from point to point, and so on. This is the condition that rules out <a class="external" href="https://wildandnoncompactknots.wordpress.com/2013/04/30/what-is-knot-theory-anyway/" target="_blank">so-called <dfn class="terminology">wild</dfn> knots</a>.</p></li>
<li>
<p><dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">Closed</dfn>: A curve is closed if the function \({\bf r}\colon \mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}^3\) is <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">periodic</em>, that is, if there exists a positive real number \(T\) for which,</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\text{for all }t\in \mathbb{R}, \qquad \text{we have } {\bf r}\bigl(t+T\bigr) = {\bf r}(t).
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">The smallest such \(T\) is called the <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">period</em> of the function \({\bf r}\text{,}\) and we think of a closed curve as one whose “starting point” and “ending point” are the same, \({\bf r}(0) = {\bf r}(T).\)</p>
</li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><dfn class="terminology">Simple</dfn>: A closed curve is simple if it does not intersect itself <em class="emphasis">except</em> at its starting/ending point. In other words, we cannot have \({\bf r}(t_1) = {\bf r}(t_2)\) unless \(t_1-t_2\) is a multiple of the period \(T\text{.}\) Another way to say this is to require that the function \({\bf r}:[0,T) \to \mathbb{R}^3\) to be <em class="emphasis">one-to-one</em>, i.e., require that every pair of different “times” \(0 \leq t_1 \lt t_2 \lt T\) find the curve at different points, \({\bf r}(t_1) \neq {\bf r}(t_2).\)</p></li>
